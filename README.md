# NLP-Clinical-Documentation
This repository contains the csv which contains the details of clinical documentation of patients and the working file
This dataset consists only a single column with text attributes. 
I have applied text preprocessing techniques like removing punctuation, converting to lower case, lemmetization, stemmming and tokenization
Libraries and functions learnt: string.punctuation, re, TFIdvectoriser
Since it doesn't have a target variable unsupervised learning methodology was followed
The model was built based on clustering Kmeans algorithm.
